# ABSTRACT: OpenStack REST API client

=head1 NAME

Net::OpenStack::Client

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Example usage:
    use Net::OpenStack::Client;
    ...
    my $cl = Net::OpenStack::Client->new(openrc => '/home/admin/.openrc');

For basic reporting:
    use Net::OpenStack::Client;
    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
    Log::Log4perl->easy_init($INFO);
    ...
    my $cl = Net::OpenStack::Client->new(
        openrc => '/home/admin/.openrc',
        log => Log::Log4perl->get_logger()
        );

For debugging, including full JSON request / repsonse and headers (so contains sensitive data!):
    use Net::OpenStack::Client;
    use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
    Log::Log4perl->easy_init($DEBUG);
    ...
    my $cl = Net::OpenStack::Client->new(
        openrc => '/home/admin/.openrc',
        log => Log::Log4perl->get_logger(),
        debugapi => 1
        );
